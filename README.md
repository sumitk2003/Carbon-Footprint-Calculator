The Carbon Footprint Calculator is an innovative web-based tool designed to help users assess their environmental impact. By answering a series of questions related to their household, diet, transportation, and consumption habits, users receive an estimate of their carbon footprint along with practical suggestions to reduce it. The tool is developed with an engaging and intuitive user interface that ensures accessibility for all.
The calculator uses a scoring algorithm implemented in JavaScript to compute the carbon footprint. Based on the responses, it generates tailored recommendations, such as reducing waste, consuming less meat, or opting for public transport. Additionally, the project highlights the importance of individual contributions toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with global sustainability goals.
This project not only educates users about their ecological footprint but also motivates them to adopt eco-friendly practices. It serves as a step toward creating a more environmentally conscious society, contributing to the fight against climate change.
